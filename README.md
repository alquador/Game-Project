[Basic Rendering]("/Users/quadorfamily/sei/projects/game-project/Images/My First Board (2).jpg")

[![First Rendering image]()]**IMAGE?

### User Story
The single user will be able to start clicking on the cards to reveal the image on the other side.  Toggling through as many times as needed to win the game.  The user will be able to see how many attempts it took to successful win and end the game.  There will also be a game timer, that stops once all cards are matched.


### Build Steps

1. Find images and their respective jpeg to be able to access them in the game
2. Maybe try adding neat images to the cards...like a theme.
3. Make the cards reactive to clicks
4. Determine winning matches
5. Try adding a timer
6. Try tracking how many moves it takes to complete
7. Play again button...
